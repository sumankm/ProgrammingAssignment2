# It is intended to write two functions: the first to make a matrix object with getters and setters;
# and the second function to write a function that inverts a matrix.
# As matrix operations are expensive, the second function should cache the inverted matrix.

## Write a short comment describing this function

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
